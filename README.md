Nothing outside of the usual here _just yet_.

However, if your curiosity eventually drives you to the source of my codes (hehe), feel free to leave helpful feedback if you see room for improvement anywhere.

I'm obsessively learning/reading about code architecture currently so I'm especially open to tips and different perspectives in that space.
