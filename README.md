Nothing outside of the usual here _just yet_.

However, if your curiosity drives you to the source of my codes (*kneeslap*), feel free to leave helpful feedback if you see room for improvement anywhere.

I'm obsessively learning/reading about code architecture currently so I'm especially open to tips and different perspectives in that space.

Also interested in hearing anything you have on web design strategies for someone who doesn't naturally have a knack for such things.

Some social media handle(s) so you can call me beep me if you wanna reach me:
